  Feature: Account Holder withdraws cash

  Scenario Outline: Account has sufficient funds
    Given the account balance is $<balance>
      And the card is valid
      And the machine contains enough money
     When the Account Holder requests $<requested>
     Then the ATM should dispense $<dispensed>
      And the account balance should be $<new-balance>
      And the card should be returned
    Examples:
      | balance | requested | dispensed | new-balance |
